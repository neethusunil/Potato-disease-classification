# Potato-disease-classification

Tutorial from: https://youtu.be/dGtDTjYs3xc

Farmers every year face economic loss and crop waste due to various diseases in potato plants. We will use image classification using CNN and built a mobile app using which a farmer can take a picture and app will tell you if the plant has a disease or not.

Technology stack for this project will be,

Model Building: tensorflow, CNN, data augmentation, tf dataset
Backend Server and ML Ops: tf serving, FastAPI
Model Optimization: Quantization, Tensorflow lite
Frontend: React JS, React Native
Deployment: GCP (Google cloud platform, GCF (Google cloud functions)
